👋 Hi, I'm Surya Chilukuri
I’m an Embedded Systems Software Developer by day and an avid tinkerer by night. I like bringing hardware to life through efficient, low-level code.

Beyond the Day Job:

🏠 Self-hosting & Homelabbing: Tinker with new projects and Optimizing my personal infrastructure.

🖨️ 3D Printing: Designing in Onscape and Printing on my Modified Ender.

✍️ Writing: I document my journey and technical finds at [suryachilukuri.win](https://suryachilukuri.win/).
